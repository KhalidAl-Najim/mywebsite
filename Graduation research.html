            <p>
                This study examined the impact of management information systems on the performance of banking organizations, specifically focusing on Alahli Bank in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. <br>
                
                The researchers assumed a positive relationship between well-designed management information systems and organizational performance. <br>
                
                They used a purposive random sampling method and collected 51 valid responses from 60 participants for analysis.

                Statistical methods, including SPSS, were employed to calculate measures such as mean, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. <br>
                
                The findings revealed that the dimensions of management information systems explained 78.4% of the total variance in organizational performance. <br>
                
                The study recommended that Alahli Bank officials in Riyadh adopt performance measurement programs such as Customer Satisfaction Measurement (CSM) to improve performance and achieve goals.<br>
                
                It also suggested conducting comparative studies in different contexts to further explore the role and impact of management information systems on banking organizations' performance .
